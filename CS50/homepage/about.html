        <p id="intro-text" style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 1.5em; opacity: 0;">I am a simple guy from the Slovak Republic, where I was born and raised.
          After finishing school at the age of 18 as a cook, I moved to Switzerland in search of a better standard of living. During my time there, I learned to live independently
          and matured as a person. After a decade-long career in cooking, I felt that I had achieved everything I wanted in the kitchen, and it was time for a new challenge in life.
          As someone who enjoys working with computers and staying up-to-date with modern trends, I decided to pursue a career in programming. I also wanted to return home to
          Slovakia to support my parents, girlfriend, and child. This is a brief summary of my life story. Currently, I am taking CS50, which is my first step into the world of programming</p>
