Q:  If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
A:  I would get average energy, valence, and danceability to count aura as described.
    Command would be: SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;
Q2: Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
A2: Calculation is based only at average energy, valence, and danceability, not authors/genres or how many times user listened to the track IMHO i would rather collect
    also genre & times_listened data from user and i would do it more personalized rather on base of preferred AUTORS & GENRES to match the taste of the aura and emotion of user.
    For example lets take top 10 tracks sorted by how many times user listened to them (assuming we have also columns "times_listened & genre"). When we have this data we can AI
    do the magic and create personalized aura based on top listened authors and genres.
    Command would be: SELECT genre, artist_id FROM songs ORDER BY times_listened LIMIT 10;
