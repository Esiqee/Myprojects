Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Lower amount of predictions lowers also precision of results, more attempts we have the rate of precision rises

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

IMHO 1000 attempts should be the right way
